# üì± SnapBook: Because Regular Scrapbooking Gets Your Fingers Sticky

> *"It's like scissors and glue, but your phone doesn't get covered in glitter!"*

## üåô What in the World is This Thing?

**SnapBook** is what happens when a dreamy scrapbook and a smartphone have a baby. It's a **real-time collaborative scrapbook app** where you can create digital memory collections without accidentally gluing your fingers together! With our **soft dark mode aesthetic**, it's so dreamy you might actually fall asleep while using it (please don't scrapbook and drive).

## ‚ú® Cool Stuff You Can Do With This Thing

### üì∏ Make Digital Scrapbooks (No Paper Cuts!)
- Create fancy scrapbooks with a fancy name and even fancier cover image
- Add pictures (yes, including those embarrassing ones of your friends)
- Write profound quotes like "Live, Laugh, Scrapbook" with CUSTOM STYLING
- Stuff appears in RANDOM SIZES because we like to keep you on your toes
- Drag, pinch, and rotate things like you're some kind of digital wizard
- Elements move with SOFT ANIMATIONS that make you go "oooooooh"

### ü§ù Work Together (Without Fighting Over The Glue Stick)
- Collaborate LIVE with friends using some magic called "Socket.io"
- See changes instantly, like they're sitting right next to you (but without the snack-stealing)
- Know who's viewing/editing because privacy is still a thing, even in scrapbooking

### üîç Invite Your Friends (Or Enemies, We Don't Judge)
- Hit "Share" to summon a FLOATING MODAL (fancy!)
- Search for people by username (try "scrapbook_queen69" - might be taken)
- Send invites faster than wedding invitations
- Friends can join instantly (no 3-5 business days processing time)

## üé® Looks So Good You Might Lick Your Screen (Please Don't)
- **Dreamy dark mode:** deep navy, soft purple, glowing blue & gold that makes your eyes say "thank you"
- **Fonts:** So elegant your English teacher would approve
- **Layout:** Things arranged in a "masonry-style" (which is fancy talk for "looks cool")
- Misty overlays and soft shadows that make everything look like a dream sequence in a movie

## üß† Nerdy Tech Stoff For The Curious
- Built with **Expo** (React Native) because we're too lazy to write native code
- **React Navigation** for moving between screens without getting lost
- **React Native Reanimated** for animations smoother than a freshly buttered slide
- **Socket.io-client** for that real-time magic
- **AsyncStorage / SecureStore** for keeping your stuff safe and sound

## üñ•Ô∏è Backend Magic (The Stuff You Don't See But Is Still Important)
- **Express.js server** running the show behind the scenes
- **Socket.io** making real-time updates possible without sacrificing a goat
- **REST API** handling all the boring but necessary stuff
